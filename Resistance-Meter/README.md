# Resistance Meter

Measure the resistance of an unknown resistor in ohms and output the value to the Serial Monitor.

Setup:
Connect one end of a 10K-ohm resistor to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
Connect the other end of the 10K-ohm resistor to one end of the unknown resistor.
Connect the other end of the unknown resistor to GND.
Connect the node between the reference resistor and the unknown resistor to analog input pin A0.
